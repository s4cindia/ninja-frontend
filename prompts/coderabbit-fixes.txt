In `@src/components/pdf/PdfPreviewPanel.tsx`:
- Around line 307-313: The Button in PdfPreviewPanel.tsx is using an undefined
variant "default" (Button supports primary/secondary/outline/ghost/danger);
update the Button's variant prop in the render where showHighlights is toggled
(the Button that calls setShowHighlights and uses aria-label/showHighlights) to
a supported variant such as 'primary' or 'secondary' (e.g., use
variant={showHighlights ? 'secondary' : 'outline'}) so the component uses an
existing style.

In `@src/pages/PdfAuditResultsPage.tsx`:
- Around line 132-141: The current useMemo that builds issuesByPage forces
issues without a page into page 0 via issue.pageNumber || 0; update the logic in
the useMemo that computes issuesByPage to either skip issues with undefined/null
pageNumber or place them into a clearly named separate bucket (e.g., "ungrouped"
or NaN key) instead of numeric 0; adjust the map population code (the const map
and auditResult.issues.forEach block) to check for issue.pageNumber ===
undefined/null and handle those cases explicitly so downstream
pagination/navigation that expects pages 1..pageCount is not affected.

In `@src/services/api/pdfAuditApi.example.ts`:
- Around line 96-123: When jobId changes the hook doesn't reset previous
loading/result/error state; inside useEffect at the start setResult(null),
setError(null) and setIsLoading(true) before calling
pdfAuditApi.createCancellablePolling(jobId, 2000, 300000) so the UI isn't stale;
keep abortRef assignment and existing cleanup that calls abortRef.current().
