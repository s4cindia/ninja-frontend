Implement FE-PDF-1: FileUpload Enhancement for PDF

Update the existing FileUpload component to support PDF files alongside EPUB.

File to update: src/components/shared/FileUpload.tsx (or similar location)

Requirements:

1. Add PDF MIME type to accepted files:
   - application/pdf
   - .pdf extension

2. Update file type detection:
   - Detect PDF vs EPUB based on MIME type or extension
   - Set appropriate icon for PDF files

3. Update validation:
   - PDF max file size: 100MB (may be larger than EPUBs)
   - Validate file is actually a PDF (check magic bytes if possible)

4. Update UI text:
   - "Upload EPUB or PDF file" (or similar)
   - Update helper text to mention both formats
   - Update error messages to be format-aware

5. Pass file type to parent:
   - Include fileType: 'epub' | 'pdf' in upload callback
   - Parent component can route to appropriate audit endpoint

6. Maintain backward compatibility:
   - All existing EPUB functionality must continue working
   - No breaking changes to component props

Reference: Look at existing FileUpload implementation for patterns.

Tests: Update FileUpload.test.tsx to include PDF upload scenarios.
