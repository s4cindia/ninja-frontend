In `@src/components/acr/NACriteriaSection.tsx`:
- Around line 244-256: The label "Rationale for N/A Status" is not
programmatically linked to the textarea, so update the JSX in NACriteriaSection
to add a unique id on the textarea (e.g., id="na-rationale" or similar) and set
the label's htmlFor to that id; keep the existing bindings
(value={editingReason}, onChange={e => setEditingReason(e.target.value)}) and
other props unchanged to preserve behavior, and optionally add aria-describedby
or aria-label only if additional context is required.
- Around line 177-194: The toggle button in NACriteriaSection lacks ARIA
attributes; update the button rendered in the category loop (the one that calls
toggleCategory(category)) to include aria-expanded={isExpanded} and
aria-controls pointing to a stable unique id for the content panel (e.g.,
`na-panel-${category}`), and add a matching id attribute to the expanded content
container that renders the criteria so screen readers can associate the control
with the panel; ensure the id generation uses the category value (or a sanitized
slug) so it stays consistent across renders.

In `@src/components/acr/VersionHistory.tsx`:
- Line 245: The component is accessing .version and .changes but the hooks
return different shapes; normalize the hook outputs before use: after calling
useVersionHistory map each ReportVersion (with versionNumber) to include a
version field (e.g. create normalizedVersions = versions?.map(v => ({...v,
version: v.versionNumber})) ?? [] and use normalizedVersions instead of versions
and currentVersion), and after calling useVersionDetails map its ReportData to
include a changes field (or default changes: [] when absent) so the component's
accesses (currentVersion, usages at the places referencing .version and
.changes) match the expected shape; update references to use the normalized
objects and keep the original hook calls unchanged (refer to useVersionHistory,
useVersionDetails, currentVersion, and versionDetails).

In `@src/pages/acr/AcrReportReviewPage.tsx`:
- Around line 412-426: The object passed to VerificationSummaryCard uses unsafe
any casts for status and history; remove the "as any" and "as any[]" and instead
import or define the exact types expected by VerificationSummaryCard (e.g. the
Status union/enum and the HistoryItem[] type), then type the properties
explicitly (status: <ImportedStatusType>, history: <ImportedHistoryItemType>[]),
ensure confidenceScore remains a number 0-1 and confidenceLevel is typed as
'high'|'medium'|'low'|'manual', and update the object literal (status,
confidenceScore, confidenceLevel, automatedResult, automatedNotes, history) to
use those concrete types rather than any.

In `@src/pages/acr/AcrWorkflowPage.tsx`:
- Around line 297-301: Replace the unsafe any cast on confidenceData.criteria
with a proper type assertion or runtime guard so analysisResults receives a
CriterionConfidence[]: in the useEffect where you call
setAnalysisResults(confidenceData.criteria as any), change it to assert
confidenceData.criteria as CriterionConfidence[] or (preferably)
validate/transform confidenceData.criteria into an array of CriterionConfidence
before calling setAnalysisResults (e.g., check
Array.isArray(confidenceData.criteria) and map/verify required fields) so the
types line up with the analysisResults state and the ESLint warning is resolved.

In `@src/pages/acr/VerificationQueuePage.tsx`:
- Line 108: The prop criteriaFromAnalysis is being forced to any because
VerificationQueue expects CriterionConfidence[] but useConfidenceWithIssues
returns CriterionConfidenceWithIssues[]; remove the cast and either (A) update
the VerificationQueueProps type to accept CriterionConfidenceWithIssues[]
(change the prop type in VerificationQueue component) or (B) add a small mapper
(e.g., mapCriterionWithIssuesToCriterion) that converts
CriterionConfidenceWithIssues[] to CriterionConfidence[] and pass the mapped
array; locate usages around VerificationQueue (prop name criteriaFromAnalysis)
and the hook useConfidenceWithIssues to implement the chosen fix.
