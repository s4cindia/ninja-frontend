In `@src/components/acr/VersionCompareModal.tsx`:
- Around line 112-114: The close Button in VersionCompareModal is icon-only and
lacks an accessible name; update the Button (the one rendering <X className="h-4
w-4" /> and calling onClick={onClose}) to include an aria-label (e.g.
aria-label="Close" or aria-label="Close version compare modal") and optionally a
title attribute so screen readers and hover users can identify it; ensure the
label text is concise and consider using existing localization utilities if the
component uses i18n.

In `@src/pages/acr/AcrReportReviewPage.tsx`:
- Around line 83-88: The clickable header div with role="button" and
tabIndex={0} lacks keyboard activation; add an onKeyDown handler (on the same
element that uses showEditModal, onToggleExpand, and isExpanded) that listens
for Enter (key === "Enter") and Space (key === " " or key === "Spacebar") and
calls onToggleExpand() only when !showEditModal, and also call
event.preventDefault() for Space to avoid scrolling; ensure the handler mirrors
the onClick guard so keyboard users can expand/collapse the criteria.
- Line 611: The status rendering uses acrJob.status.replace('_', ' ') which only
replaces the first underscore; update the code in AcrReportReviewPage where
acrJob.status is formatted (the JSX element showing acrJob.status) to replace
all underscores—either call replaceAll('_', ' ') or use a global regex (e.g.,
replace(/_/g, ' '))—so multi-underscore statuses like "pending_ai_review" render
correctly.
- Around line 355-359: The variable _versionData is assigned from
response.json() but never used; remove the unused assignment to satisfy the
linter by either deleting the declaration entirely or awaiting and discarding
the JSON (e.g., replace "const _versionData = await response.json();" with
"await response.json();" ) and keep the existing alert/TODO comment in the
restore placeholder in AcrReportReviewPage so future implementation can consume
the response.

In `@src/pages/acr/AcrWorkflowPage.tsx`:
- Around line 342-363: The initializeReport call is using state.fileName with a
hard fallback "Untitled Document", which can overwrite a valid title stored in
state.documentTitle; update the payload to use documentTitle with the same
fallback logic used by the upload flow (prefer state.documentTitle, then
state.fileName, then the default) and add state.documentTitle to the useEffect
dependency array; locate the initializeReport invocation and the surrounding
useEffect (references: initializeReport, state.fileName, state.documentTitle,
navigate) and adjust the documentTitle value and deps accordingly.
