- Around line 1-25: Fix three issues: (1) In PdfPreviewPanel.tsx update the
Button that toggles showHighlights (the one calling setShowHighlights and using
aria-label/showHighlights) to use a supported variant (e.g.,
variant={showHighlights ? 'secondary' : 'outline'}) instead of the undefined
'default'. (2) In PdfAuditResultsPage.tsx change the useMemo that builds
issuesByPage (the map and auditResult.issues.forEach logic) so it does not force
undefined/null issue.pageNumber into page 0; either skip those issues or place
them into a separate bucket (e.g., "ungrouped" or NaN key) and ensure downstream
code still expects pages 1..pageCount. (3) In pdfAuditApi.example.tsx inside the
useEffect that calls pdfAuditApi.createCancellablePolling(jobId, 2000, 300000)
reset prior state at the start of the effect by calling setResult(null),
setError(null), and setIsLoading(true), while keeping the existing abortRef
assignment and cleanup that calls abortRef.current().

In `@src/services/api/pdfAuditApi.example.tsx`:
- Around line 193-195: The example assigns htmlReport from
pdfAuditApi.getAcrReport(jobId, 'html') but never uses it; either use the value
in the example (e.g., log or return it) or mark it as intentionally unused by
renaming to _htmlReport, or remove the HTML fetch entirely. Update the snippet
around the pdfAuditApi.getAcrReport call (htmlReport) to one of these three
options so there is no unused variable warning.
