In `@lint/lint` errors 1.txt:
- Around line 1-55: The file "lint/lint errors 1.txt" contains CI/log output and
should not be committed; remove this file from the repository (delete the file
and commit the deletion) and, if you need to preserve such logs, move them to CI
build artifacts or a dedicated logs folder that is not committed, and add a rule
to .gitignore to prevent re-adding (reference the filename "lint/lint errors
1.txt" when locating the offending file and update your commit to remove it).

In `@src/components/epub/EPUBUploader.tsx`:
- Around line 215-222: For PDF uploads, disable the multipart/form-data fallback
and require a successful presign; update uploadService.uploadFile (and/or the
presign call it relies on) so that when the file's MIME/type indicates PDF
(e.g., selectedFile.type or filename.endsWith('.pdf')) it does not call or fall
back to uploadDirect and instead surfaces an error if the presign step fails;
ensure the calling code around uploadService.uploadFile (referencing
endpoint.directUpload and uploadResult) handles and surfaces that error to the
user rather than attempting a form upload.

In `@src/components/pdf/PdfPreviewPanel.test.tsx`:
- Around line 45-50: Tests reference placeholder strings that the
PdfPreviewPanel component does not render; update either the tests or the
component. Option A: change tests in PdfPreviewPanel.test.tsx to assert the
actual behavior of PdfPreviewPanel (e.g., check for loading indicators and that
react-pdf's Document/Page elements or their test-ids are rendered) instead of
'PDF Preview Placeholder'/'Install react-pdf to enable PDF rendering'. Reference
the test file's existing test cases and the PdfPreviewPanel component exports
(PdfPreviewPanel) to locate assertions to update. Option B: if you prefer
placeholder behavior, modify PdfPreviewPanel to detect a missing react-pdf
(e.g., dynamic import/try-catch or feature flag) and render the placeholder
strings used in tests ('PDF Preview Placeholder' and 'Install react-pdf to
enable PDF rendering'), then keep tests as-is; ensure the placeholder branch is
covered by tests.
- Around line 21-22: Tests currently use jest.fn(); update the mocks to Vitest
by replacing jest.fn() with vi.fn() for mockOnPageChange and mockOnIssueSelect
and add an import for vi from 'vitest' at the top of the test file so the
symbols mockOnPageChange and mockOnIssueSelect use Vitest's mocking API.
- Around line 123-130: The test fails because PdfPreviewPanel's internal
numPages remains null (handleDocumentLoadSuccess not invoked), so the
next-button guard (if (numPages && currentPage < numPages)) prevents calling
onPageChange; fix the test in PdfPreviewPanel.test.tsx by either: 1) passing a
numPages prop to the rendered component (e.g., render(<PdfPreviewPanel
{...defaultProps} currentPage={1} numPages={3} />) so clicking the "Next page"
button calls mockOnPageChange(2)), or 2) mocking react-pdf to simulate a
successful load and invoking handleDocumentLoadSuccess to set numPages before
clicking the next button; update the test to use one of these approaches and
assert mockOnPageChange was called with 2.

In `@src/components/pdf/PdfPreviewPanel.tsx`:
- Around line 28-32: Replace the hardcoded CDN worker URL assigned to
pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc in PdfPreviewPanel (where you import
Document, Page, pdfjs) with the import.meta.url-based local bundling approach
recommended by react-pdf: set pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc to new
URL('pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js', import.meta.url).toString() so the
worker matches the installed pdfjs-dist version and avoids external CDN/CSP
issues.

In `@src/pages/PdfAuditResultsPage.tsx`:
- Around line 346-351: The Breadcrumbs usage passes items with { label, href }
but the component expects { label, path }, so update both Breadcrumbs instances
(the one around PDF Accessibility / Audit Results and the later instance at
lines ~370-374) to replace href with path for each item; ensure the prop names
match the Breadcrumbs component interface so links render as navigable links
rather than plain text.

In `@src/services/api/pdfAuditApi.example.ts`:
- Around line 332-456: The component and examples call React namespace APIs
(e.g., PdfAuditComponent uses React.useState and React.ChangeEvent;
handleFileChange references React.ChangeEvent; batchProcessExample uses no JSX
but the file declares `declare const React: any;`) yet there is no runtime React
import, causing "React is undefined"; fix by adding a real import at the top
(either import React from 'react' to preserve React.useX calls or replace
namespace calls with named hook imports like import { useState, useEffect,
useRef, ChangeEvent } from 'react' and update PdfAuditComponent accordingly) and
remove the placeholder `declare const React: any;`.

In `@src/services/api/pdfAuditApi.ts`:
- Around line 355-409: The pollForCompletion loop can surface POLLING_ABORTED
when the timeout fires during sleep; to ensure timeouts consistently surface as
POLLING_TIMEOUT, add a flag (e.g., timeoutReached) initialized false, set it to
true inside the setTimeout handler before calling abortController.abort(), and
then in the loop/final abort-handling path check that flag: if timeoutReached
throw the PdfApiError with code 'POLLING_TIMEOUT' (408), otherwise throw
'POLLING_ABORTED' (499); update references in pollForCompletion (timeoutId,
abortController, PdfApiError, getAuditStatus, getAuditResult) accordingly and
keep clearing timeoutId in finally.
